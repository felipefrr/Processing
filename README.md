## BasicStar
It's a star made with lines, I really recommend to try drawing it on a paper first, so gratifying.

Cool story: The first time that I saw this star, it was in philosophy class and my teacher drew it on the board and then asked for my classmates to draw the same star. I couldn't do it for the first time, but I remember spending a whole afternoon trying to remake the same drawing.
